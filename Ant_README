README razza ant

In the terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the project.

Here is a list of targets that are included in the ant build system, along with a description of what each of the targets does.  To run the target, just type it into the command line from the root directory.  For example, type "ant clean" to remove the build directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ant clean - Removes the build directory which contains all of the bytecode for the algorithms and the test suites.

ant compile - Creates the build directory.  Compiles all the source code in the "src" directory and moves the resulting bytecode to the "build" directory.  Compiling also includes setting the appropriate classpath.  

ant jar - Creates a jar file called SAT.jar in the root directory.  This archive contains all of the bytecode for the algorithms and test suites.

ant test - By default, this target runs all of the JUnit test suites.  In order to run a subset of the test suites, you must add the parameter "-DtestSuiteSubset=testSuites", where "testSuites" is a space delimited list of the test suites that you wish to run.  Any number of test suites may be entered in the parameter.  For example:
ant test -DtestSuiteSubset="BubbleSortTest ShellSortTest"
will only execute the test suites for bubble sort and shell sort.

ant cloc - Runs the Count Lines of Code (CLOC) tool on both the "algorithms" and "tests" directories.  This tool reports the number of blank, commented, and source code lines in each directory.

---------------------Cobertura Tasks - Targets to Run the Cobertura Tool-----------------------
ant cobertura-clean - removes the files and directories created by running the Cobertura tool.

ant cobertura-instrument - First in a list of tasks necessary to generate a Cobertura test coverage report.  This task separates the instrumented classes and puts them in the /build/instrumented directory.

ant cobertura-run - Runs all the test suites in order to produce a coverage report.

ant cobertura-run-bubble - Runs just BubbleSortTest test suite in order to create a coverage report for on the BubbleSortTest test suite.

ant cobertura-report - Creates the coverage report for the appropriate test suite(s).  The file that is created in called index.html.

ant cobertura-display - Opens the coverage report index.html in the Firefox web browser.

ant cobertura - runs all of the commands necessary to create a Cobertura test coverage report for all the test suites associated with the razza project.  If you choose this target, there is no need to run any of the above Cobertura targets.  They are all included in this single target.
